## Handling of `parental_education_level` Column

During analysis, I made the decision to remove the `parental_education_level` column.  
Although it may show some correlation with student performance, deeper reflection and research showed that:

> **Both educated and uneducated parents can be pushers.**  
> Pressure from any parent — regardless of background — can negatively affect a student’s habits, emotions, and autonomy.

This column also contained around **9% missing values**, which would require assumptions or dropping rows — both of which could damage data integrity.

Most importantly, **parental personality, care, and presence** are what truly shape a student,  
and those cannot be captured by a single education label.

I chose to remove this column not just for technical reasons,  
but to make sure this project remains fair, respectful, and focused on the student — not on stereotypes.

> _In this project, we value students more than data._
